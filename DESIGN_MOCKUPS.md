## Next Steps

1. Review each mockup in your browser
2. Consider which aesthetic best fits your app's purpose (helping musicians practice)
3. Note which elements you'd like to incorporate
4. We can then implement the chosen design into your React app

## Notes

These are static mockups showing the visual design. They don't include the actual YouTube player functionality - that will be integrated when we implement the chosen design into your React codebase.
