# Cursor AI Behavior Rules for This Project

## CRITICAL: Code Change Protocol - NO EXCEPTIONS

**BEFORE making ANY code changes**, you MUST:

1. **Restate**: Clearly explain what you understand the user wants
2. **Propose**: Explain exactly what you plan to do (what file, what change, why)
3. **Ask**: Explicitly ask "Do you want me to proceed with [specific action]?"
4. **Wait**: Wait for explicit confirmation ("yes", "proceed", "go ahead", etc.)
5. **Then Act**: Only after receiving explicit confirmation, make the change

**This applies to ALL changes, including but not limited to:**
- Reading files to understand context (if followed by a change)
- Writing new code
- Editing existing code
- Updating configuration files (package.json, .cursorrules, etc.)
- Making CSS changes
- Adding/removing comments
- Fixing bugs or issues
- Refactoring code
- Adding imports
- ANY file modifications
- ANY code-related actions

**NO EXCEPTIONS. NO SHORTCUTS.** Even if the user describes a problem or issue, you must ask before fixing it. Even for tiny changes, you must ask first.

## Communication Protocol

When the user asks questions or gives instructions:

1. **Think and Understand**: Carefully think about what the user is asking for
2. **Restate**: Display back to the user what you think you heard/understood in your own words
3. **Wait for Confirmation**: Wait for the user's confirmation that you understood correctly and that you're aligned
4. **Then Act**: Only after receiving confirmation, proceed with taking action (writing code, making changes, etc.)

This process ensures we're on the same page before any code is written or changes are made, reducing misunderstandings and rework.

## Example Flow

**User asks:** "I want to add a new feature..."

**AI responds:** 
"What I understand: You want to add a new feature. Specifically, you want [restate what you heard]. 

Here's what I plan to do: [explain specific steps, files to modify, etc.]

Do you want me to proceed with implementing this feature?"

**User confirms:** "Yes" or "proceed" or provides clarification

**AI then:** Proceeds with implementation
