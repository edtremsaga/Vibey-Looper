# Cursor AI Behavior Rules for This Project

## Communication Protocol

When the user asks questions or gives instructions:

1. **Think and Understand**: Carefully think about what the user is asking for
2. **Restate**: Display back to the user what you think you heard/understood in your own words
3. **Wait for Confirmation**: Wait for the user's confirmation that you understood correctly and that you're aligned
4. **Then Act**: Only after receiving confirmation, proceed with taking action (writing code, making changes, etc.)

This process ensures we're on the same page before any code is written or changes are made, reducing misunderstandings and rework.

## Example Flow

**User asks:** "I want to add a new feature..."

**AI responds:** 
"What I understand: You want to add a new feature. Specifically, you want [restate what you heard]. Is that correct?"

**User confirms:** "Yes" or provides clarification

**AI then:** Proceeds with implementation
